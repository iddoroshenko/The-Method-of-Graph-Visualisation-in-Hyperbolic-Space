This is the first public release of the Walrus source code, which is licensed
under the GNU GPL.

See BUILDING for instructions on compiling the source.

See README.RUN for instructions on running Walrus (but you should ignore all
references to 'walrus.jar', since this source distribution doesn't include
it, nor is it needed; however, if you wish to create a 'walrus.jar' for your
own uses, then execute the shell script 'mkjar' after building Walrus).
README.RUN also contains other useful information, such as pointers to
documentation on the LibSea file format and information about mailing lists.

Documentation for the source code is embarrassingly lacking, but see
'docs/classdiagram.jpg'.  The GUI frontend is implemented in H3Main.java,
and this may be the best starting point for exploring the source code.
This file has grown rather unruly over time and includes a good many inner
classes, but the remainder of the Walrus source code is better structured
than H3Main.java, so keep your hopes up while digging around.

Although nothing requires this, you may wish to download the LibSea source
code as well, from <http://www.caida.org/tools/visualization/libsea/>.
